The data is organized into the following folders:

## Experimental results
This folder contains the data collected with an oscilloscope during the PHIL tests in the laboratory. Notice that the numbering on the CSV files does not match the case names in the submitted version of the manuscript.

  - C1.CSV: raw data of Case 1 with Vbacsd=81V and Ibacsd=72A
  - C3.CSV: raw data of case 2 with Vbacsd=363V and Ibacsd=72A
  
## Models
The models and script that can be made publicly available will be placed in this folder after the peer-review process.
